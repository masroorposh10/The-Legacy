The Legacy Project is a web application developed using React and AWS services. It provides a platform to pay tribute and keep track of the death details of legendary people. The project integrates with the ChatGPT OpenAI API to generate condolence paragraphs based on the uploaded pictures, names, and dates. It also utilizes AWS Python Lambda for the backend functionality and leverages cloudinary to store the pictures. Moreover, Amazon Polly is used to convert the condolence text generated by the ChatGPT API into speech.

Key Features
Obituary Tracking: The Legacy Project allows users to upload pictures, enter names, and specify dates to create obituaries for legendary individuals.
Condolence Generation: By leveraging the ChatGPT OpenAI API, the application automatically generates heartfelt condolence paragraphs based on the provided information.
Cloudinary Integration: The project seamlessly integrates with Cloudinary, a cloud-based media management solution, to store and manage the uploaded pictures.
Text-to-Speech Conversion: Amazon Polly, a text-to-speech service by AWS, is used to read out the condolence text generated by the ChatGPT API, making it more accessible and engaging.
Secure API Key Storage: The application securely stores API keys in AWS Systems Manager, ensuring the protection of sensitive information.
